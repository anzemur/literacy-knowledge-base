One moonlight night a Fox was prowling about a farmer’s hen-coop, and
saw a Cock roosting high up beyond his reach. “Good news, good news!”
he cried.
“Why, what is that?” said the Cock.
“King Lion has declared a universal truce. No beast may hurt a bird
henceforth, but all shall dwell together in brotherly friendship.”
“Why, that is good news,” said the Cock; “and there I see some one
coming, with whom we can share the good tidings.” And so saying he
craned his neck forward and looked afar off.
“What is it you see?” said the Fox.
“It is only my master’s Dog that is coming towards us. What, going so
soon?” he continued, as the Fox began to turn away as soon as he had
heard the news. “Will you not stop and congratulate the Dog on the
reign of universal peace?”
“I would gladly do so,” said the Fox, “but I fear he may not have heard
of King Lion’s decree.”
Cunning often outwits itself.
