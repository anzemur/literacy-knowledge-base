It happened that a Fisher, after fishing all day, caught only a little
fish. “Pray, let me go, master,” said the Fish. “I am much too small
for your eating just now. If you put me back into the river I shall
soon grow, then you can make a fine meal off me.”
“Nay, nay, my little Fish,” said the Fisher, “I have you now. I may not
catch you hereafter.”
A little thing in hand is worth more than a great thing in prospect.
