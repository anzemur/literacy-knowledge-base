An Ass once found a Lion’s skin which the hunters had left out in the
sun to dry. He put it on and went towards his native village. All fled
at his approach, both men and animals, and he was a proud Ass that day.
In his delight he lifted up his voice and brayed, but then every one
knew him, and his owner came up and gave him a sound cudgelling for the
fright he had caused. And shortly afterwards a Fox came up to him and
said: “Ah, I knew you by your voice.”
Fine clothes may disguise, but silly words will disclose a fool.
