The Lion and the Fox went hunting together. The Lion, on the advice of
the Fox, sent a message to the Ass, proposing to make an alliance
between their two families. The Ass came to the place of meeting,
overjoyed at the prospect of a royal alliance. But when he came there
the Lion simply pounced on the Ass, and said to the Fox: “Here is our
dinner for to-day. Watch you here while I go and have a nap. Woe betide
you if you touch my prey.” The Lion went away and the Fox waited; but
finding that his master did not return, ventured to take out the brains
of the Ass and ate them up. When the Lion came back he soon noticed the
absence of the brains, and asked the Fox in a terrible voice: “What
have you done with the brains?”
“Brains, your Majesty! it had none, or it would never have fallen into
your trap.”
Wit has always an answer ready.
