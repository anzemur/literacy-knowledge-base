A Horse and an Ass were travelling together, the Horse prancing along
in its fine trappings, the Ass carrying with difficulty the heavy
weight in its panniers. “I wish I were you,” sighed the Ass; “nothing
to do and well fed, and all that fine harness upon you.” Next day,
however, there was a great battle, and the Horse was wounded to death
in the final charge of the day. His friend, the Ass, happened to pass
by shortly afterwards and found him on the point of death. “I was
wrong,” said the Ass:
“Better humble security than gilded danger.”
