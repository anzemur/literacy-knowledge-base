An old man on the point of death summoned his sons around him to give
them some parting advice. He ordered his servants to bring in a faggot
of sticks, and said to his eldest son: “Break it.” The son strained and
strained, but with all his efforts was unable to break the Bundle. The
other sons also tried, but none of them was successful. “Untie the
faggots,” said the father, “and each of you take a stick.” When they
had done so, he called out to them: “Now, break,” and each stick was
easily broken. “You see my meaning,” said their father.
Union gives strength.
