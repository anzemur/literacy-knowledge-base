One hot summer’s day a Fox was strolling through an orchard till he
came to a bunch of Grapes just ripening on a vine which had been
trained over a lofty branch. “Just the thing to quench my thirst,”
quoth he. Drawing back a few paces, he took a run and a jump, and just
missed the bunch. Turning round again with a One, Two, Three, he jumped
up, but with no greater success. Again and again he tried after the
tempting morsel, but at last had to give it up, and walked away with
his nose in the air, saying: “I am sure they are sour.”
It is easy to despise what you cannot get.
