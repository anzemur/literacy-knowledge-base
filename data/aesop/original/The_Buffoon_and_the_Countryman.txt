At a country fair there was a Buffoon who made all the people laugh by
imitating the cries of various animals. He finished off by squeaking so
like a pig that the spectators thought that he had a porker concealed
about him. But a Countryman who stood by said: “Call that a pig’s
squeak! Nothing like it. You give me till tomorrow and I will show you
what it’s like.” The audience laughed, but next day, sure enough, the
Countryman appeared on the stage, and putting his head down squealed so
hideously that the spectators hissed and threw stones at him to make
him stop. “You fools!” he cried, “see what you have been hissing,” and
held up a little pig whose ear he had been pinching to make him utter
the squeals.
Men often applaud an imitation and hiss the real thing.
