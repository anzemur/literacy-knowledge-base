A Lion used to prowl about a field in which Four Oxen used to dwell.
Many a time he tried to attack them; but whenever he came near they
turned their tails to one another, so that whichever way he approached
them he was met by the horns of one of them. At last, however, they
fell a-quarrelling among themselves, and each went off to pasture alone
in a separate corner of the field. Then the Lion attacked them one by
one and soon made an end of all four.
United we stand, divided we fall.
