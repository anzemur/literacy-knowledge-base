A Hare was very popular with the other beasts who all claimed to be her
friends. But one day she heard the hounds approaching and hoped to
escape them by the aid of her many Friends. So, she went to the horse,
and asked him to carry her away from the hounds on his back. But he
declined, stating that he had important work to do for his master. “He
felt sure,” he said, “that all her other friends would come to her
assistance.” She then applied to the bull, and hoped that he would
repel the hounds with his horns. The bull replied: “I am very sorry,
but I have an appointment with a lady; but I feel sure that our friend
the goat will do what you want.” The goat, however, feared that his
back might do her some harm if he took her upon it. The ram, he felt
sure, was the proper friend to apply to. So she went to the ram and
told him the case. The ram replied: “Another time, my dear friend. I do
not like to interfere on the present occasion, as hounds have been
known to eat sheep as well as hares.” The Hare then applied, as a last
hope, to the calf, who regretted that he was unable to help her, as he
did not like to take the responsibility upon himself, as so many older
persons than himself had declined the task. By this time the hounds
were quite near, and the Hare took to her heels and luckily escaped.
He that has many friends, has no friends.
