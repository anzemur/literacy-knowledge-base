A Dog looking out for its afternoon nap jumped into the Manger of an Ox
and lay there cosily upon the straw. But soon the Ox, returning from
its afternoon work, came up to the Manger and wanted to eat some of the
straw. The Dog in a rage, being awakened from its slumber, stood up and
barked at the Ox, and whenever it came near attempted to bite it. At
last the Ox had to give up the hope of getting at the straw, and went
away muttering:
“Ah, people often grudge others what they cannot enjoy themselves.”
