The Hare was once boasting of his speed before the other animals. “I
have never yet been beaten,” said he, “when I put forth my full speed.
I challenge any one here to race with me.”
The Tortoise said quietly, “I accept your challenge.”
“That is a good joke,” said the Hare; “I could dance round you all the
way.”
“Keep your boasting till you’ve beaten,” answered the Tortoise. “Shall
we race?”
So a course was fixed and a start was made. The Hare darted almost out
of sight at once, but soon stopped and, to show his contempt for the
Tortoise, lay down to have a nap. The Tortoise plodded on and plodded
on, and when the Hare awoke from his nap, he saw the Tortoise just near
the winning-post and could not run up in time to save the race. Then
said the Tortoise:
“Plodding wins the race.”
